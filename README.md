This simple tray app for Windows 10 allows you to switch system theme (Dark/Light) with one click, so you won't need to go to the Settings app page every time to change it. You can also set it to auto start with Windows.

### Requirements

- .NET Core Runtime 3.1 ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime))

### Current status

The app is basically done. There are some things I want to fix, change or add in the future:

- Make context menu look native
- Add more languages

### Notes

Windows 10 version 1903+ is required for full theme switching. However, the app can be used on earlier Windows 10 versions to switch mode for apps, not affecting the system mode as there is no Light theme. High contrast themes are not supported.
