This simple tray app for Windows 10 allows you to switch system theme (Dark/Light) with a click, which may be helpful when you have to take a lot of screenshots so you won't need to go to the Settings app page every time to change it. 

- Dark theme — click on the tray icon **once**.
- Light theme — click on the tray icon **twice**.

You also can set it to auto start with Windows.

### Requirements

- .NET Core Runtime 3.1 ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime))

### Acknowledgements

- [Hardcodet NotifyIcon for WPF](https://github.com/hardcodet/wpf-notifyicon)

### Notes

The app will work on all Windows 10 versions with Dark and Light mode for apps support. Light theme for system was first introduced in Windows 10 1903 so you'll need to be using this OS version or newer for proper switching.
