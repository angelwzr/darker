# darker
This simple tray app for Windows 10 allows you to switch system theme (Dark/Light) with a click, which may be helpful when you have to take a lot of screenshots so you won't need to go to the Settings app page every time. 

- Dark theme — click on the tray icon **once**.
- Light theme — click on the tray icon **twice**.

### requirements

- .NET Core Runtime 3.1 ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/current/runtime))

### current status

The app is basically done but there are some things left to do:

- add theme detection
- make context menu look native
- add about page

### notes

The app will work on all Windows 10 versions with Dark and Light mode for apps support. Light theme for system was first introduced in Windows 10 1903 so you'll need to be using this OS version or newer for proper switching.
